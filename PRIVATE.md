**Anything that shouldn't be public goes in the /private folder in the root of this repo!**

Instructions for getting the private folder:

1. Contacting Luca De Alfaro, as the google cloud services are most likely not running.
2. Go to the [Wikitrust2 shared google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0AI9biCC0Mc_sUk9PVA) & download the private folder.
3. Unzip the downloaded folder and move it to this repo so `wikitrust2.0/private/...`.
